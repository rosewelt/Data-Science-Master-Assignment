We know that Bernoulli distribution applies to events that have one trial (n = 1) and two possible outcomes—for example, one coin flip (that’s the trial) and an outcome of either heads or tails. When we have more than one trial—say, we flip a coin five times—binomial distribution gives the discrete probability distribution of the number of “successes” in that sequence of independent coin flips (or trials).\n",
